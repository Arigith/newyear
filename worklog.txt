Title: Day 2
Date: 20/12/2022
Info: Decided today to journal my worklog and if I get time then to add an additional page to my frontend and add my journal to this. Decided that if I get that far then I would try and use an old project for this.
    To frontend added journal page
    To backend added worlog.txt
    Coded models.py to have tables and columns I require
    Coded database.py to check/create database called project.db if not already created once command was run
    Coded main.py to use fastapi, give access to frontend and to run command for database.py
    Updated worklog.txt
    Added to Github
    Updated readme
