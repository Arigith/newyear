	<h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
	<p>Everything that can be seen on this site has been written and created all by me.</p>
	<p>My objective in showing this website is to showcase a few of the things I have learnt from the AWS restart program. In essence this is the start of what I hope to be my IT portfolio</p>
	<p>I have learnt my skills through the AWS Restart program held by Unitech NZ and was facilitated by Kris and Nick.</p>
	<p>You can find out more about what was taught on the about page of this website</p>
